#Diswords - a Discord bot for playing "Words"

you may be a bit confused, so,

##What is "Words"?

"Words" is a famous russian game. You can find the rules [here](https://github.com/NedoProgrammer/NedoProgrammer/blob/master/Words.md "here").

##Ok, well, how do I start playing it?

Here's a quick GIF showing how to create a basic game:

`dw.` is the default prefix of the bot. You can always change it :D

##How do I build it?

To run this script, you'll need to build it.
It uses .NET Core, which you can install here: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/NedoProgrammer/Diswords.git`

2. `cd` into the project directory: `cd Diswords`

3. Build the project: `dotnet build --configuration Release`  

When finished, you'll find the executable in `/bin/Release/netcoreapp3.1/`

##And this is the end?

No, I'll update this README with new stuff and add new features to the bot, but not now.
I also plan to upload it to some hosting service so you could play it without building and running it on your machine.
